# 🤖 Agentists Quick Start

Welcome to the Agentists Quick Start repository - your opinionated guide to getting started with agentic engineering. 🚀

## 🧠 What is Agentic Engineering?

Agentic engineering is the practice of building, deploying, and managing AI agents that can autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with various systems. This repository provides best practices and ready-to-use configurations to accelerate your journey into this emerging field.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. 🌐 Remote-First Development
**All coding is performed remotely in isolated environments. No running on local.**
- Use containerized development environments (DevPods)
- Ensures consistency across team members
- Eliminates "works on my machine" issues
- Provides clean separation between development and personal environments

### 2. 🏗️ Agent-Centric Architecture
**Design systems with autonomous agents as first-class citizens.**
- Build modular, composable agent components
- Implement clear agent boundaries and responsibilities
- Use standardized communication protocols between agents
- Design for scalability from single agent to multi-agent swarms

### 3. 📈 Continuous Learning and Adaptation
**Agents should evolve and improve through interaction and feedback.**
- Implement feedback loops for agent performance
- Use versioning for agent behaviors and models
- Track agent decisions and outcomes for analysis
- Enable A/B testing of agent strategies

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Docker or Podman installed
- VS Code with Dev Containers extension
- Git
- Basic understanding of containerization

### ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jedarden/agentists-quickstart
   cd agentists-quickstart
   ```

2. **Choose a DevPod**
   - Navigate to `devpods/examples/`
   - Select either `basic-devpod` or `security-devpod`

3. **Open in VS Code**
   - Open the chosen devpod folder in VS Code
   - Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
   - Wait for the environment to build

4. **Start Building**
   - All tools and dependencies are pre-installed
   - Begin developing your agentic applications

## 🐳 DevPods

DevPods are our implementation of containerized development environments. They provide:

- Pre-configured development tools
- Consistent environments across all developers
- Isolation from local system
- Easy onboarding for new team members

See the [DevPods documentation](devpods/README.md) for detailed information.

## ✅ Best Practices

1. **Always develop in containers** - Never install development dependencies on your local machine
2. **Document your agents** - Clear documentation of agent capabilities and limitations
3. **Test agent interactions** - Implement comprehensive testing for multi-agent scenarios
4. **Monitor agent behavior** - Use logging and observability tools
5. **Version everything** - Agent code, configurations, and training data

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please ensure:

1. All code is developed within a DevPod
2. Follow the established patterns and principles
3. Include documentation for new features
4. Test thoroughly before submitting
